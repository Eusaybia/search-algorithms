Sample Files for 1A
You can download the following three sample files with expected pagerankList.txt files. For your
reference, I have also included the file log.txt which includes values of Win, Wout, etc. Please
note that you do NOT need to generate such a log file.

Use format string "%.7f" to output pagerank values. Please note that your pagerank values might be
slightly different to that provided in these samples. This might be due to the way you carry out
calculations. However, make sure that your pagerank values match to say first 6 decimal points to
the expected values. For example, say an expected value is 0.1843112, your value could be 0.184311x
where x could be any digit.

All the sample files were generated using the following command:

% pagerank  0.85  0.00001  1000
ex1
ex2
ex3
