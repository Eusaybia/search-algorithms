Someone suggested I post this here-- quantum mechanics and mattress stores
submitted 5 months ago by dWintermut3

I'm convinced that mattress/furniture stores exist in a quantum superposition of grand opening and
going out of business sale.

It is both and neither at once until an observer records the state at which point it becomes one or
the other.

But because you know exactly where the store is located, you cannot know how fast it is going out of
business because of your uncertainty about its business momentum.

All around us, all the time pairs of anti-discount mattress stores and discount mattress stores are
popping into existence, forming the quantum memory foam that is the basis for the universe. Without
the pressure of this quantum memory foam strip malls would collapse.

We can see evidence of this when a pair is created such that one half is within the sales radius of
a supermassive furniture store like Ikea-- one of them is pulled in and the other escapes as a
Hawking mattress store.
