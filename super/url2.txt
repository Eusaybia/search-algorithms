Edsger W. Dijkstra
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (Dutch: [ˈɛtsxər ˈʋibə ˈdɛikstra] (About this sound listen); 11 May 1930 –
6 August 2002) was a Dutch computer scientist and an early pioneer in many research areas of
computing science who held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences at the University
of Texas at Austin from 1984 until his retirement in 1999. A theoretical physicist by training, he
worked as a programmer at the Mathematisch Centrum (Amsterdam) from 1952 to 1962. He was a professor
of mathematics at the Eindhoven University of Technology (1962–1984) and a research fellow at the
Burroughs Corporation (1973–1984).

One of the most influential members of computing science's founding generation, Dijkstra helped
shape the new discipline from both an engineering and a theoretical perspective. Many of his
papers are the source of new research areas. Several concepts and problems that are now standard in
computer science were first identified by Dijkstra or bear names coined by him.

Computer programming in the 1950s to 1960s was not recognized as an academic discipline; Dijkstra,
who had a background in mathematics and physics, was one of the driving forces behind the acceptance
of computer programming as a scientific discipline. Dijkstra coined the phrase "structured
programming" and during the 1970s this became the new programming orthodoxy. Dijkstra's
ideas about structured programming helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the
professional discipline of software engineering, enabling programmers to organize and manage
increasingly complex software projects.

The academic study of concurrent computing started in the 1960s, with Dijkstra (1965) credited with
being the first paper in this field, identifying and solving the mutual exclusion problem. He
was also one of the early pioneers of the research on principles of distributed computing. His
foundational work on concurrency, semaphores, mutual exclusion (mutex), deadlock (deadly embrace),
finding shortest paths in graphs, fault-tolerance, self-stabilization, among many other
contributions comprises many of the pillars upon which the field of distributed computing is built.
Shortly before his death in 2002, he received the ACM PODC Influential-Paper Award in distributed
computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed
the Dijkstra Prize (Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing) the following year, in his
honor.
