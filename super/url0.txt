To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely
subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical
viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his
characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for
instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate
the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about
LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t
appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which
itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now
just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan
Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the
ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own,
preferably lower, beforehand. Nothin personnel kid.
