Quisqualamine
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Quisqualamine is the α-decarboxylated analogue of quisqualic acid, as well as a relative of the
neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). α-Decarboxylation of excitatory
amino acids can produce derivatives with inhibitory effects. Indeed, unlike quisqualic acid,
quisqualamine has central depressant and neuroprotective properties and appears to act predominantly
as an agonist of the GABAA receptor and also to a lesser extent as an agonist of the glycine
receptor, due to the facts that its actions are inhibited in vitro by GABAA antagonists like
bicuculline and picrotoxin and by the glycine antagonist strychnine, respectively. Mg2+ and
DL-AP5, NMDA receptor blockers, CNQX, an antagonist of both the AMPA and kainate receptors, and
2-hydroxysaclofen, a GABAB receptor antagonist, do not affect quisqualamine's actions in vitro,
suggesting that it does not directly affect the ionotropic glutamate receptors or the GABAB receptor
in any way. Whether it binds to and acts upon any of the metabotropic glutamate receptors like
its analogue quisqualic acid however is unclear.
