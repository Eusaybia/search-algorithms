Remy Bordignon
I'm a |  Developer.Student.Co-op Scholar.

Welcome!
My name is Remy Bordignon and I am a first year Software Engineer at the University of New South Wales.

My passions include Basketball, AFL, beaches, hiking and technology. I grew up in Coffs Harbour, and have just moved to Sydney with support from the UNSW Co-op Scholarship. I've always had a passion for understanding technology, but now I finally get to dive in trying to understand the complexity of the crazy tech around us as a full time student.

I'm hoping to slowly add my own personal projects and upload my resume to website as my technical skills progress.
