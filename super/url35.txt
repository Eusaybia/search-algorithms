The Best Torrent Sites: October 2017
Below is a big list of torrent sites, more or less in the order that we prefer to search from. If you're new to torrents, don't forget that you'll need a torrent client to get these files! We have a list of the Best Torrent Downloader Software if you're interested. Hook it all up to a smart TV, grab the popcorn and get comfy. 

Note: All torrent sites in this table are working unless otherwise noted, at least as of the last update to this page. Let us know if we need to add or subtract a listing. 

Torrent Site    What We Like
The Pirate Bay  This site is a classic! TPB It has been around in one incarnation or another for a long time and the torrents are and have always been, trusted here.
RARBG   This torrent site is for P2P enthusiasts. It's full of quality, high-resolution torrents. It's about quality here, not quantity.
1337X   If you're after older or more obscure torrents, 1337X might be for you. Their torrent database isn't nearly as large as some others, but it might have just what you're after.
ExtraTorrent    Another super popular source for torrents. This site has come and gone but lives here... for now.
LimeTorrents    This is another torrent site you don't want to skip in your search. Users love the size of their database and the frequency of legitimate files.
TorrentDownloads    We love the super straightforward torrent detail page at TorrentDownloads. That would be reason enough to give this one a try but the big database and high quality of torrents make it a great choice.
Demonoid    The Demonoid site has been serving up torrents since 2003 as a number of different domains. This is a private membership community so you'll need an invite to join.
IsoHunt Also beginning in 2003, IsoHunt has gone through a lot of changes but even in its newest incarnation, is a very popular torrent search engine.
YTS.AG  Frequently written off as a TIFY/YTS impersonator soon after launch, most users find YTS.AG torrents to be high quality and legit.
Torrentz2   This is like a super torrent index, searching for torrents across dozens of other torrent sites. You can see the complete list in their sites in our index page.
KAT This super popular torrent site is formally referred to as "Kickass Torrents" and lives across various mirror sites.
TorrentProject  TorrentProject has around 10 million torrents indexed and is an often cited favorite. Ed. Note: This site was blacked out as of Oct. 2, 2017. New URL not working at this time; will recheck in early November.
TorrentFunk This is a pretty popular torrent site, in no small part due to its "verified" status indication, as well as user comments.
Torlock This is the "no fake torrent" site you've been waiting for. The site actually pays its users $1 per fake torrent they find.
EZTV    You won't find every torrent you're after here, but users say the quality of the torrents you do find is consistently good.
WorldWide Torrents  Set aside the aggressive splash screen on WWT's home page, this torrent index is worth a look.  Ed. Note: This site was blacked out as of Oct. 2, 2017. New URL not working at this time; will recheck in early November.
Sky Torrents    With a huge database and pretty clean interface, it's no wonder this multi-million strong collection of torrents is one we frequently hear about.
BTScene A clean interface and relative lack of annoying advertising make BTScene one of our favorites.
Torrents.me This meta torrent site isn't too special among all the others but we love the amazing dashboard on their home page. If you're a data nerd and a torrent fan, you'll appreciate what they've done.
iDope   The iDope torrent site is worth mentioning if only for its innovative iDope Android app. P2P file sharing right from your smartphone or tablet!
YourBittorrent  The clean interface is a big reason to try this torrent searcher... especially if you're new to BitTorrent.
Monova  A nice, clean design is reason enough to spend time here. Advertising can be an issue at times but if you can get over that, it's a great torrent site.
Toorgle This is another "meta" torrent search engine, pulling in the databases from over 450 torrent sites into one place.
Seedpeer    With a sizable database of torrents, Seedpeer is and always has been a great place to search. The interface isn't as nice as some others, but it's still a very usable site.
