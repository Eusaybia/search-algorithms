Justaid: Helping Researchers To Construct Scientific Models 

It is very difficult, if not impossible, for researchers to manually evaluate and revise their
scientific models using a vast amount of relevant information now available to them. JustAid, a new
tool for scientific discovery, successfully integrates techniques from Knowledge Acquisition and
Machine Learning in a way that complements their strengths to overcome their weaknesses, and
provides an interactive environment to help researchers in a process of scientific discovery.
JustAid can use information stored in medical databases and assist experimental scientists in
forming, testing and revising scientific models, without a need of a knowledge engineer. JustAid has
been applied to a real world problem in the area of neuroendocrinilogy, a branch of physiology.
