New Academic Calendar - UNSW3+
UNSW is moving to a new academic calendar model from 2019.

The new calendar consists of three normal terms each with ten weeks teaching, and an optional five-week summer term. The new academic calendar is called UNSW3+. We are working closely with students, staff and industry over the next two years to ensure every student is prepared for this exciting and progressive change.

See below for what you need to know to prepare yourself for the 2019 transition.
